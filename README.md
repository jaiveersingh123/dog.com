            <img src = "labr.jpg" height="700px";/>
            <p class ="labra">A Labrador Retriever is a medium-sized dog breed with an average height of 55-62 cm and a weight of 29-36 kg.While making this breed, the main focus of breeders was to have a friendly, yet working dog. Jobs that don’t require physical strength, bite force, or fighting spirit. To do such jobs labradors are originated.Labrador comes under a sporting group of dogs. This means they are extremely energetic and loves to play. If you live in an apartment, then you have to properly walk and exercise your dog. Having a backyard or some open space at your house is recommended to own this breed, if not you can increase exercise.Labrador is a very intelligent breed too, due to which you can easily train him for agility or obedience. Make sure to have high-quality treats while training, as they are food motivated.If you are planning to own a labrador, then the best way you can make this breed happy is by providing a swimming pool. If your home doesn’t have one (like me), you can get a plastic one, or if there are rivers, beaches, lakes, or anything watery you can take your labrador there.Labrador Retriever is titled to be an excellent breed with family, children, seniors, or with one who is physically and mentally unwell. Due to their playful and gentle nature, children love them the most, and so do they. You can think of a Labrador as a lady in a village who calls everyone passing by, to have a chit-chat session. For a labrador, a stranger is just another person whom he can play with.the price of labrador from the pet shop is 8,000 to 20,000 and if you are buying from a breeder the prie is 20,000 to 30,000. if you give a standard food price is 3,000 to 4,000 and if you give a premium the price is 4,000 to 5,000.the deworming tablet price is 100 and vaccination is 800-1500 and groaming is 500 to 1000</p>
